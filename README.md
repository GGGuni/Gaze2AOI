# Gaze2AOI
Gaze2AOI is a lightweight utility codebase for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research.
It provides simple implementations to classify gaze points into areas of interest (AOIs):

1. Facial AOI classification – determines which predefined facial region (e.g., forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, mouth, chin) a gaze point falls into.

2. Stimuli classification – identifies which of two presented stimuli a gaze point is directed toward.
